# How to configure it
After you installed the configuration package, feel free to run the Moondust Editor. Once you started "TheXTech SDK" configuration package a first time, you will get the question about configuring it. Answer **Yes**. Then, you will need to select the directory that contains resources of TheXTech-based game. On macOS, you should select the Application of TheXTech-based game (Super Mario Bros. X, Adventures of Demo, etc.). Once you selected the valid location, the final message will appear, and Editor will start its normal work.
