;Defines the available characters which can be printed
; is possible to have multiple font textures

texture = "font2_misc.png" ;File name of font texture

; Map of font
;
; Entry format (monospace fonts):
; position y0 x1 = value X
;
; Example:
; 0-1 = "X"
;
;
; Entry format (with a width subtracting at left and right ):
; position y0 x1  = value X, padding-left 2, padding-right 3
;
; Example:
; 0-1 = "X23"
;
;
; Entry format (map same coordinate to multiple places):
; position y0 x1 z1 = value X, padding-left 2, padding-right 3
;
; Example:
; 0-1-0 = "X23"
; 0-1-1 = "x45"
; Note: z1 can have any number value, but required to have different for same X and Y pair.
; That need to make INI value names be different or all first values are will be overwritten by last
;
